# Summary

Welcome to the Bike Company Project README! This document provides an overview of the proposed project, its objectives, and a guide on how to get started. The project was presented as a stage in the selection process for a job position, offering me an opportunity to demonstrate my skills and understanding of the problem.

## Project Background
The project revolves around a national company specializing in the sale of bicycles across multiple countries. The company boasts a robust sales database with extensive information on their sales activities.

This is an exploratory analysis of data from this bicycle company's dataset. The aim of the study was to:

- Gain insights into sales performance;
- Define priorities and commercial strategy;
- Compare sales from different clients and sectors;
- Draw up specific actions and strategies to boost the company's results.

## Tools

Power BI was used to build data visualizations through reports and dashboards. 

To complement the analysis and show my knowledge of other tools, Google Colab was used to produce a report with the data using Python.
