# Summary

Welcome to the Bike Company Project README! This document provides an overview of the proposed project, its objectives, and a guide on how to get started. The project was presented as a stage in the selection process for a job position, offering me an opportunity to demonstrate my skills and understanding of the problem.

## Project Background
The project revolves around a national company specializing in the sale of bicycles across multiple countries. The company boasts a robust sales database with extensive information on their sales activities.

This is an exploratory analysis of data from this bicycle company's dataset. The aim of the study was to:

- Gain insights into sales performance;
- Define priorities and commercial strategy;
- Compare sales from different clients and sectors;
- Draw up specific actions and strategies to boost the company's results.

## Basic information

A national company's main product is the sale of bicycles in various countries. It has a consistent database with lots of information on sales.

## What was asked

The data should be reported weekly for the sales team to put together strategies during the week and monthly in a meeting for C-Level.

## Strategic approach

My approach entailed creating a comprehensive report to showcase the database insights holistically. 

To achieve this, I utilized Power BI to present a report and set up a weekly information dashboard. 
Furthermore, with the available data from the preceding week, I compiled an additional report.

Additionally, we conducted an initial exploratory analysis with Python to gain a better understanding of the metrics and data that we need to analyze.
